Common issues and resolution steps.

## Auto-login does not work

### Smart Card Service Not Running

You connect to a Windows host from the Teleport UI, land on the Windows login
screen and nothing happens.

You can click on the username, click `Sign-in options` and click on the smart
card icon. The error message is: **"No Valid Certificates Were Found on This
Smart Card"**.

**Solution:** Enable the Smart Card Service

Usually, this means that the Smart Card service is not running on the target
host.

First, make sure that you [enable the Smart Card service in Group
Policy](./getting-started.mdx#enable-the-smart-card-service).

If that doesn't help, log into the target host directly, open the "Services"
program from the "Start" menu and check that the "Smart Card" service is in the
"Running" state.

If the "Smart Card" service is not running, open PowerShell and run
`gpupdate.exe /force`. This forces a Group Policy sync and should pick up the
service changes.

### Smart Card Certificate Not Trusted

You connect to a Windows host from the Teleport UI, land on the Windows login
screen and see an error message: **"The smartcard certificate used for
authentication was not trusted"** (or similar).

**Solution:** Import the Teleport CA

This means that the host does not trust the Teleport CA.

First, make sure that you [import the Teleport CA into Group
Policy](./getting-started.mdx#create-another-gpo-and-import-the-teleport-ca). Note that if the
Teleport CA was rotated since the last import, you will have to fetch the
new CA using the following command:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tctl auth export --type=windows >user-ca.cer
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=myuser
$ tctl auth export --type=windows >user-ca.cer
```

</ScopedBlock>

If that doesn't help, log into the target host directly, open PowerShell and
run `gpupdate.exe /force`. This forces a Group Policy sync and should pick up
the new CA.

## New session "hangs"

### Host Unreachable

You click `CONNECT` on a Windows host from the Teleport UI, a new tab opens but
nothing is displayed other than the top bar. After a while, an error is
displayed about a failed connection.

**Solution:** Open Firewall for RDP Traffic

This happens when the `windows_desktop_service` can't reach the target Windows
host.

First, make sure that you [open the RDP
port](./getting-started.mdx#open-firewall-to-inbound-rdp-connections) and [allow
remote RDP connections in Group
Policy](./getting-started.mdx#allow-remote-rdp-connections).

If that does not help, check if the target host is online and try to `ping` it
from the Linux server that runs `windows_desktop_service`. If the host is
online but not reachable, there is some other networking barrier in the way,
specific to your infrastructure.

### Hostname Does Not Resolve

Connections to Windows Desktops hang during connection establishment, or the
Teleport debug logs show errors of the form
`couldn't resolve winserver.example.com`.

**Solution:** Ensure Firewall Permits DNS Traffic

For desktops that are automatically discovered via LDAP, Teleport makes DNS
queries against the LDAP server in order to resolve the hostname to an IP
address.

Ensure that your firewalls allow inbound DNS traffic on port `53` from the
instance(s) running Teleport's Windows Desktop Service to the LDAP server
(Active Directory Domain Controller).

## Teleport fails to start

### Invalid LDAP Credentials

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 49 "Invalid Credentials": 80090308: LdapErr: DSID-0C0903C5, comment: AcceptSecurityContext error, data 52e, v2580\x00
```

**Solution:** Fix Credentials

This means that your LDAP username and password were not correct. Double-check
them in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`.

Note that the LDAP username must be formatted as `DOMAIN\User`, where `DOMAIN`
is the NetBIOS name for the domain. For example, user `Administrator` in domain
`example.com` should be formatted as `EXAMPLE\Administrator`.

### Incorrect Domain

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 10 "Referral": 0000202B: RefErr: DSID-0310082F, data 0, 1 access points
"\tref 1: 'xample.com'"
"\x00"
```

**Solution:** Correct Domain

This means that your domain name is likely wrong. Double-check the `domain`
field in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`.

### Domain Controller Unreachable

Teleport fails to start with an error similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 200 "Network Error": dial tcp ad.example.com:389: i/o timeout
```

**Solution:** Check LDAP Address

This means that your Domain Controller is down or unreachable. Double-check the
`addr` field in the `ldap` section of `windows_desktop_service`. If it's
correct, check that the Domain Controller is up and reachable from the server
that runs `windows_desktop_service`.

### Cannot Initialize LDAP over TLS

Teleport fails to connect to LDAP on startup. You may see errors similar to:

```text
LDAP Result Code 52 "Unavailable": 00000000: LdapErr: DSID-0C090F78, comment: Error initializing SSL/TLS, data 0, v2580\x00
```

or

```text
connecting to LDAP server: unable to read LDAP response packet: read tcp 172.18.0.5:35970->;172.18.0.4:636: read: connection reset by peer
```

**Solution:**  Enable LDAPS

This means you do not have an LDAP certificate installed on your LDAP servers,
or you are trying to make an insecure connection on port `389`. Teleport requires
secure LDAPS connections, which are typically on port `636`. First, confirm that
you are connecting to the correct LDAPS port. If that doesn't resolve your
issue, you can
[instal Active Directory Certificate Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/install-the-certification-authority)
(AD CS) or
[import](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority)
your own third party certificate. Note that Active Directory is
[extremely picky](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority#requirements-for-an-ldaps-certificate)
so take care to generate your certificates correctly.
