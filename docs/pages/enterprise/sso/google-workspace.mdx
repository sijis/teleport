This guide will explain how to configure [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) to be a
single sign-on (SSO) provider to issue SSH credentials to specific groups of users.
When used in combination with role based access control (RBAC) it allows SSH administrators
to define policies like:

- Only members of "DBA" Google group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.
- ... and many others.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started youâ€™ll need:

<Tabs>
<TabItem
  scope={["enterprise"]} label="Enterprise">

- A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
  [Getting Started](/docs/enterprise/getting-started) guide.

- The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= (=teleport.version=),
  which you can download by visiting the
  [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login).

  ```code
  $ tctl version
  # Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)

  $ tsh version
  # Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]}
  label="Teleport Cloud">

- A Teleport Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the
  [sign up page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin your free trial.

- The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= (=teleport.version=).
  To download these tools, visit the [Downloads](/docs/cloud/downloads) page.

  ```code
  $ tctl version
  # Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)

  $ tsh version
  # Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
- A Google Workspace super administrator account. We recommend setting up a separate super admin account with 2FA as opposed to granting your daily user super admin privileges.
- Ability to create a Google Cloud project, which requires signing up for Google Cloud. Note that this guide will not require using any paid Google Cloud services.
- Ability to set up Google Workspace groups.

## Step 1/4. Enable default OIDC authentication

(!docs/pages/includes/enterprise/oidcauthentication.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Configure Google Workspace

The setup will consist of:

- Determining whether your Google Workspace plan is correct for your Teleport
  usage
- Creating a new project on Google Cloud Platform
- Configuring OAuth consent for the new project
- Creating an OAuth client ID to allow Google Workspace users to log in to your
  Teleport cluster
- Creating a service account for Teleport to fetch the additional Google Groups
  data.

### Ensure your Google Workspace plan is correct

Teleport's Google Workspace integration works differently depending on your
Google Workspace plan. In this section, we will explain how to determine if
Teleport supports your current Google Workspace setup.

#### How Google Workspace APIs differ by service level

In Google Workspace, **transitive group membership** takes place when a user is
a member of one group by virtue of being in another group. This happens when a child
group is nested within a parent group, so that a member of a child group is also
a member of the parent group.

Google Workspace service accounts can determine whether a user has a transitive
membership to a specific group by calling methods within the Google Workspace
**Cloud Identity API**. These API methods are only usable for users belonging to
specific Google Workspace plans:

- Enterprise Standard
- Enterprise Plus
- Enterprise for Education
- Cloud Identity Premium

The Google Workspace **Directory API** allows administrators to list users and
groups in their Google Workspace domain, but does not enable them to query
transitive group memberships. The Directory API is available for all Google
Workspace plans.

#### How Teleport uses Google Workspace APIs

Teleport's OIDC connector uses Google Workspace's APIs differently depending
on the resource version.

We will show you how to configure the connector later in the
guide, but for now, you should ensure that your Google Workspace plan allows you
to use Teleport as you intend.

We currently support OIDC connector versions `v2` and `v3`.

<Notice type="tip">

Teleport versions prior to 8.1.2 only support `v2` of the OIDC connector.

</Notice>

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="v3">

The OIDC connector maps a user's roles to the Google Workspace groups they
belong to.

In order to list a user's Google Workspace groups, Teleport will first attempt to
fetch credentials for calling Cloud Identity API methods, then use these
credentials to query a user's transitive group memberships.

If these credentials do not exist, Teleport will fetch credentials for the
Directory API instead, and will use this API to list the user's groups in your
entire Google Workspace account. Groups that the user belongs to that are
external to the workspace will not be listed.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="v2">

The OIDC connector maps a user's roles to the Google Workspace groups they belong to.

If these credentials do not exist, Teleport will fetch credentials for the
Directory API instead, and will use this API to list the user's groups within
your Google Workspace domain. Any group registered on a different domain or
subdomain than the user's will be ignored.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### How to check your current plan

To troubleshoot whether your Google Workspace plan supports querying transitive
group memberships, you can visit the
[Groups Inspection](https://admin.google.com/ac/groupsinspection) page in the
Google Admin Console, which relies on the Cloud Identity API.

If your Google Workspace plan does not support the Cloud Identity API, you must
ensure that your RBAC does not depend on transitive group memberships.

When querying transitive group memberships, we recommend blocking access to
external groups at the workspace level (following [these
instructions](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9468710)), as membership in
any group that the service account doesn't have full visibility on (including
all groups external to the workspace) will prevent users from logging in.

### Create a new project

In the GCP console, choose to [Create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard).

  ![creation of a Google Cloud Platform project](../../../img/googleoidc/new-project.png)

### Configure OAuth consent

On the
[OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)
page of the GCP console, select"Internal" as your User Type.

![configuration of the OAuth consent screen](../../../img/googleoidc/consent-screen-1.png)

  Configure the appearence of your connector by picking a visible name, user support email, etc.

### Select scopes

Select the `.../auth/userinfo.email` and `openid` scopes.
    ![select email and openid scopes](../../../img/googleoidc/consent-screen-2.png)

Enable the
[Cloud Identity API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudidentity.googleapis.com)
or the
[Admin SDK API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/admin.googleapis.com)
for transitive and direct group membership, respectively. Enabling both is fine.

<Notice type="warning">

Your Google Workspace account must enable support for the API you choose to use.

Please consult the documentation for your chosen API to ensure that you have the
correct Google Workspace plan.

</Notice>

### Create an OAuth client ID

In the [Create an OAuth client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) page of the GCP console, select "Web application" as the Application type, pick a name, then add the following as an authorized redirect URI.

```txt
https://<address of proxy server>:3080/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
```

    ![OAuth client ID creation](../../../img/googleoidc/clientid-creation.png)

  Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the next screen or by clicking "Download OAuth client".
    ![OAuth client data](../../../img/googleoidc/clientid-data.png)

### Create a service account

On the [Create a service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create) page, pick a name for your service account. Leave project access grants and user access grants empty.
    ![service account creation](../../../img/googleoidc/serviceacct-creation.png)

  Click the newly-created account to view its details, and copy the Unique ID for later.
    ![service account unique ID](../../../img/googleoidc/serviceacct-uniqueid.png)

  Create a new key for the service account, select JSON as the key type, and save the resulting JSON file.
    ![service account key creation](../../../img/googleoidc/serviceacct-key.png)
    Later, we will make this JSON available to the Teleport Auth Server via the OIDC Connector configuration, either by referencing a local file or pasting the JSON into the configuration YAML. If you plan to take the first approach, you will need to upload the JSON to the Auth Server.

<Admonition type="note">
  Teleport requires the service account JSON to be available to all Teleport Auth Server hosts when deploying Teleport in a High Availability configuration. Unless you paste the JSON into the OIDC Connector configuration, you will need to upload the JSON file to all Auth Server hosts.
</Admonition>

### Configure domain-wide delegation

Configure [domain-wide
  delegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation) for your
  newly-created service account:

  Click "Add new" and add the numeric Unique ID that you've copied earlier.
    ![domain-wide delegation](../../../img/googleoidc/domainwidedelegation.png)

  Add either the
    `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly` scope or
    the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly` scope.
    The scope granted to the service account will determine if Teleport will
    fetch both direct and indirect groups or just direct groups, respectively.


## Step 3/4. Create an OIDC connector

Create the following OIDC connector [resource spec](../../setup/reference/resources.mdx) as `gworkspace-connector.yaml`. We will explain how to choose values for fields within the resource spec below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self Hosted">
    ```yaml
    (!examples/resources/gworkspace-connector.yaml!)
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">
    ```yaml
    (!examples/resources/gworkspace-connector-inline.yaml!)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The email that you set for `google_admin_email` **must** be the email address of a user that has permission to list all groups, users, and group membership in your Google Workspace account. This user will generally need super admin or group admin privileges.


Do not use the email of the service account for `google_admin_email`. The configuration display will look the same, but the service account will not have the required domain-wide delegation.

The `client_id` field must be the unique ID number captured from the Google Cloud Platform UI. An indicator that this is misconfigured is if you see "invalid Google Workspace credentials for scopes [...]" in your log.

Create the connector using the `tctl` tool:

```code
$ tctl create gworkspace-connector.yaml
```

If you have a configured connector from a version of Teleport older than 8.1.2, you can upgrade your connector from `v2` to `v3`:

First, fetch the connector data:
```code
$ umask 077
$ tctl get --with-secrets oidc/connectorname > connector.yaml
```

Next, edit `connector.yaml` to change the version number from `v2` to `v3`, and then update the connector:

```code
$ tctl create -f connector.yaml
$ rm connector.yaml
```

Then, to start fetching transitive groups instead of just direct groups, edit
the [domain-wide
delegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation) for your
service account and swap out the OAuth scopes for
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly`. To undo the
change, remove that scope and add
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly` again.

While a `v3` connector is configured, you can no longer downgrade Teleport to a
version before 8.1.2. Before such a downgrade, follow the above instructions and
change the version number back to `v2`.

## Step 4/4. Test your Google Workspace OIDC connector

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with Google". The CLI is
the same as before:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"

  Teleport can use multiple OIDC connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=google`
