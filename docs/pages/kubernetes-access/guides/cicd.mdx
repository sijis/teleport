## Short-Lived Certs for Kubernetes CI/CD

CI/CD tools like Jenkins can use short-lived certificates to talk to the Kubernetes API.

Create a non-interactive local Teleport user. 

Non-interactive users don't have username or password defined and can't log in, but can be used
to create credentials.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: robot
spec:
  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default, nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    # This field is used for SSH logins. You have to keep 'logins' as a non-empty random value
    # for Kubernetes to work until we fix it.
    logins: ['keep any value here']
    # A list of kubernetes groups to assign
    kubernetes_groups: ['system:masters']
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  roles:
  - robot
```

(!docs/pages/includes/permission-warning.mdx!)

Generate a `kubeconfig` using the `jenkins` user and its roles using [`tctl auth sign`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tctl-auth-sign):

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
# Create a new local user for Jenkins
$ tctl users add jenkins --roles=robot
# Creates a token for 25hrs
$ tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=kubernetes --out=kubeconfig --ttl=25h
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=myuser
# Create a new local user for Jenkins
$ tctl users add jenkins --roles=robot
# Creates a token for 25hrs
$ tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=kubernetes --out=kubeconfig --ttl=25h
```

</ScopedBlock>

Verify that these credentials have been written to kubeconfig:

```code
$ cat kubeconfig
#   apiVersion: v1
#   clusters:
#   - cluster:
#      certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZ....
# This kubeconfig can now be exported and will provide access to the automation tooling.

# Uses kubectl to get pods, using the provided kubeconfig.
$ kubectl --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig get pods
```

>
  Short-lived certificates expire in hours or minutes. You don't have to revoke them if the host gets compromised.
  Generate a new kubeconfig every hour using `tctl` or [API](../../api/introduction.mdx)
  and publish it to secret storage, like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) or
  [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) secret managers.
