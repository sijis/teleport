## Introduction

Moderated Sessions allows Teleport administrators to define requirements for
other users to be present in a Server or Kubernetes Access session. Depending on
the requirements, these users can observe the session in real time, participate
in the session, and terminate the session at will.

  Moderated Sessions requires Teleport Enterprise or Teleport Cloud.

### Use cases

Moderated Sessions are useful in the following scenarios:
- When you have stringent security requirements and need to have people watching
  over user-initiated sessions on a set of servers.
- When you want to share a terminal with someone else to be able to instruct or
  collaborate.

## Policies

Moderated Sessions makes use of RBAC policies to allow for fine grained control
over who can join a session and who is required to be present to start one.

The system is based around **require policies** and **allow policies**. 

Require policies define a set of conditions that must be a met for a session to
start or run. A minimum of one policy from each relevant role the user has must
match for the session to start.

Allow policies are used to define what sessions a user can join and under what
conditions they may join a session.

## Configuring Moderated Sessions

### `require_session_join`

#### Options

The following are required options for `require_session_join`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|The name of the require policy|
|`filter`|[Filter](#filters)|An expression that, if it evaluates to true for a given user, enables the user to be present in a Moderated Session|
|`kinds`|`[]`[Session kind](#session-kinds)|The kind of session that the policy applies to|
|`modes`|`[]`[Participant mode](#participant-modes)|The participant mode that applies to the user joining the Moderated Session under this policy|
|`count`|Integer|The number of users that need to match the filter expression to satisfy the policy|

#### Example

The policy below specifies that the `prod-access` role must have a minimum of
two users with the role `auditor` and the mode `moderator` present in the
session to start it. The policy applies to SSH and Kubernetes sessions only.

When a user with this require policy starts a session, it will be pending until
the policy is fulfilled. 

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: prod-access
spec:
  allow:
    require_session_join:
      - name: Auditor oversight
        filter: 'contains(user.roles, "auditor")'
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator']
        count: 2
```

#### Combining Policies

The authorizer applies require policies within a role together with an OR operator and the policies from each role with an AND operator. In practice, this means that for every role with at least one require policy, one of its policies must be met before a session can be started.

### `join_sessions`

#### Options

The following are required options for `join_sessions`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|The name of the allow policy|
|`roles`|[]String|A list of names for Teleport roles that this policy applies to. Users with this role are eligible to join a Moderated Session under this policy.|
|`kinds`|`[]`[Session kind](#session-kinds)|The kind of session that the policy applies to|
|`modes`|`[]`[Participant mode](#participant-modes)|The participant mode that applies to the user joining the Moderated Session under this policy|

#### Example

The following allow policy attaches to the role `auditor` and allows one to
join SSH and Kubernetes sessions started by a user with the role `prod-access`
as a moderator or observer.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: auditor
spec:
  allow:
    join_sessions:
      - name: Auditor oversight
        roles : ['prod-access']
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator', 'observer']
```

### Filters

Filter expressions allow for more detailed control over the scope of an allow
policy or require policy.

Require policies can specify which users they consider as valid with a filter
expression. The filter context has a `user` object defined with the set fields
`roles` and `name`.

Here is an example of a filter expression that evaluates to true if the user is
Adam or if the user has the trait `cs-observe`:

```
equals(user.name, "adam") || contains(user.roles, "cs-observe")
```

A filter expression is a string statement used to define logic based on a set of
input variables. The filter expressions follow a restricted subset of Go syntax
and supports the following functions and operators:

- `contains(set, item)`: Returns true if the item is in the set, otherwise
  false. The set can be a string or an array.
- `equals(a, b)`: Returns true if the two values are equal, otherwise returns
  false.
- `![expr]`: Negates a boolean expression.
- `[expr] && [expr]`: Performs a logical AND on two boolean expressions.
- `[expr] || [expr]`: Performs a logical OR on two boolean expressions.

### Session kinds

Require and allow policies have to specify which sessions they apply to. Valid
options are `ssh` and `k8s`.

- `ssh` policies apply to all SSH sessions on a node running the Teleport SSH server.
- `k8s` policies apply to all Kubernetes sessions on clusters connected to Teleport.

### Participant modes

A participant joining a session will always have one of three modes:

- `peer`: Can join and collaborate in a session. They can view output and send
  input.
- `moderator`: Can join and watch a session. They can view output and
  forcefully terminate the session at will.
- `observer`: Can join and watch a session. They cannot control the session in
  any way.

When joining a session with `tsh join` or `tsh kube join`, a user can specify a
mode with the `--mode <mode>` flag , where the mode is one of `peer`,
`moderator` or `observer`. By default, the mode is `peer` for SSH and
`moderator` for Kubernetes sessions.

A participant may leave a session with the shortcut `c` while in observer or
moderator mode. When in moderator mode, a participant may also forcefully
terminate the session at any point in time with the shortcut `t`.

### Require policy count

Require policies can have a variable amount of users that need to match the
filter expression in order to satisfy the policy. The `count` field of a require
policy is a positive integer value that specifies the minimum amount of users
this policy requires.

## Backwards compatibility with Server Access

Previously, Server Access did not include controls over which users can join a
session. To work around this, RBAC rules are ignored for users that only have
V4 roles (`version: v4` in the role specification). New roles are created as
V5. V4 roles are upgraded when they are modified in the UI. If a user has any
attached V5 roles (`version: v5` in the role specification), the new RBAC access
checks will be enforced.

## MFA-based presence

When `per_session_mfa` is set to `true` via [role or cluster
settings](../../access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa.mdx), Teleport enforces
MFA-based presence checks for moderators. This requires that all moderators
wishing to join have a configured U2F or WebAuthn MFA token.

Every 30 seconds, Teleport will issue a prompt to the user in the terminal,
asking them to press their MFA token in the next 15 seconds. This will happen
continously during the session and exists so that moderators are always present
and watching a given session.

If no MFA input is received within 60 seconds, the user is kicked from the
session which may pause it, if RBAC policies are no longer met.

## Session invites

When starting an interactive SSH or Kubernetes session using `tsh ssh` or `tsh
kube exec` respectively, one may supply a `--reason <reason>` and/or an
`--invited <users>` flag where `<reason>` is a string and `<users>` is a
comma-separated list of usernames.

This information can be picked up by a third party integration and may for
example be used to enable notifications over some external communication system.
